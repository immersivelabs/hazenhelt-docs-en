# Prologue

Long ago, in the world of Eldoria, there existed a powerful element stone known as Hazenhelt. It was a mysterious, glowing stone that radiated energy and power, and was said to be the embodiment of the purest form of magic. The Hazenhelt was the origin of all magic in the realm and was highly prized.

According to legend, Hazenhelt was always present in the world of Eldoria, waiting to be discovered by the first settlers - after known as the Druids. They were said to have been guided by the spirits of the land, who showed them the stone and revealed its power to them.

The Druids became a powerful and mysterious order of magic-users who devoted their lives to protect the world. They were later revered as wise and powerful healers, protectors, and scholars, and their teachings were passed down from generation to generation.

They believed Hazenhelt stone was the key to maintaining the balance of power in the world and that it must be protected at all costs.&#x20;

People from all over the world of Eldoria were drawn to the later known as the Temple of the Druids, seeking its guidance and the protection provided by the stone Hazenhelt. Over time, a thriving civilization grew around the temple which was also used to offer tribute to the five elements of nature and seek the blessings of the spirits.

The druids were not just powerful magic-users, they were also skilled in the art of healing, using their connection to the elements to cure diseases, soothe wounds, and maintain the balance to the land. They were respected and revered by the people of Eldoria, who relied on their guidance and protection in times of trouble.

In this way, the druids played a crucial role in maintaining stability and order in the world, and their work was seen as a sacred duty.

The temple was also considered a place of pilgrimage for the tribes of the realm. It was here that the tribes would come together to perform rituals. The temple was a symbol of unity and peace, a place where the tribes could come together in shared reverence for the elements of nature.
