# Tribes

The realm of Eldoria is separated into five main tribes, each specializing in one of the elements of Hazenhelt: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Spirit. Each tribe has their own unique classes that reflect the dominant element of that tribe and the skills that are most valued by its people. Here are three possible classes for each realm, with a brief explanation of why they are separated:

1. **The Ddraig of the Fire Element, ruled by Queen Birren** - A proud and noble people who reside in towering cities made of shimmering crystal. They are known for their mastery of magic and their love of knowledge. They are opposed to the Fomorians of the Water Element.
   * Pyromancers: These practitioners of the Fire Element are experts in creating and controlling flames, using their abilities to incinerate enemies and ignite even the hardest materials.
   * Warlocks: The Warlocks of the Ddraig are experts in dark magic, using their connection to the Fire Element to summon powerful demons, curses, and other malevolent forces.

In the realm of Eldoria, the main reason for conflict between the tribes is the desire for control over the elemental powers and the fear of a possible catastrophic explosion mainly caused by the unbalance of the elements. The tribes each specialize in one of the elemental powers and view their mastery over their respective element as a source of strength and pride.

Additionally, some tribes may view the power of other elements as a threat to their own and may seek to eliminate that threat. For example, the Ddraig may see the Fomorians as a threat to their fire-based abilities and may seek to eliminate their power.

There may also be tensions between tribes due to their beliefs and philosophies. The Fir Bolg tribe may view the Druidh as too focused on the spiritual realm and not enough on the physical world, while the Druidh may view the Fir Bolgas too focused on physical power and not enough on the spiritual realm.

Ultimately, the conflict between the tribes is driven by a combination of fear, pride, and differing beliefs and philosophies. Despite these conflicts, the people of Eldoria have learned to work together when faced with a common threat, and the druids of the old who once restored the Hazenhelt stone still live on as legends in the hearts and minds of the people.
